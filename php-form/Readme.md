This website implements a boilerplate academic conference
website. This project is Markdown- and Pandoc-backed, with typical
conference features like registration pages and abstract submission.

This uses a wireframe [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/), which
resets the stylesheet (`normalize.css`); sets up useful classes
implementing a grid and selects reasonable enough defaults
(`skeleton.css`); and specifies the conference webpage style
(`custom.css`). The colors, font-faces, and other parameters should be
updated prior to deployment.

Colors can be chosen using something
like [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/).
